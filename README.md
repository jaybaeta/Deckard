# Deckard
Deckard is a KDE Plasma theme based on [@varlesh](https://github.com/varlesh)'s Plasma 5 port of 
[@horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180)'s [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) theme, and inspired by the colours of [@kkga](https://github.com/kkga)'s [spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) Sublime theme.

This theme is presently not ready to be used.
